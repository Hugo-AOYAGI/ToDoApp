# ToDoApp

This app will allow you to manage the tasks of your week like any other **ToDo** app.  
I'm am only making it to learn programmation and mainly the **electron** framework.

Feel free to use it or change it however you want to.

Please note that any feedback is appreciated, I'm still learning   
and I'd love to know what I could improve on in my code or even on my git hub repo.

Things left to do:  
   __- Calendar__  
   __- Task Repeat function__  
   __- Task notification__    
   __- Next Task Element__    
   __- Add save for checkbox settings__   
   __- CSS hover and active animations__   
   __(- Dark mode)__
