# ToDoApp

This app will allow you to manage the tasks of your week like any other **ToDo** app.  
I'm am only making it to learn programmation and mainly the **electron** framework.

Feel free to use it or change it however you want to.

Please note that any feedback is appreciated, I'm still learning programming   
and I'd love to know what I could improve on in my code or even on my git hub repo.

You'll need to go into the release build to get the actual .exe with all the files that go with it.

Here are a few images of the app :
